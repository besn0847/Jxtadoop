/** <p>The balancer is a tool that balances disk space usage on an HDFS cluster
 * when some datanodes become full or when new empty nodes join the cluster.
 * The tool is deployed as an application program that can be run by the 
 * cluster administrator on a live HDFS cluster while applications
 * adding and deleting files.
 * 
 * <p>SYNOPSIS
 * <pre>
 * To start:
 *      bin/start-balancer.sh [-threshold <threshold>]
 *      Example: bin/ start-balancer.sh 
 *                     start the balancer with a default threshold of 10%
 *               bin/ start-balancer.sh -threshold 5
 *                     start the balancer with a threshold of 5%
 * To stop:
 *      bin/ stop-balancer.sh
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>DESCRIPTION
 * <p>The threshold parameter is a fraction in the range of (0%, 100%) with a 
 * default value of 10%. The threshold sets a target for whether the cluster 
 * is balanced. A cluster is balanced if for each datanode, the utilization 
 * of the node (ratio of used space at the node to total capacity of the node) 
 * differs from the utilization of the (ratio of used space in the cluster 
 * to total capacity of the cluster) by no more than the threshold value. 
 * The smaller the threshold, the more balanced a cluster will become. 
 * It takes more time to run the balancer for small threshold values. 
 * Also for a very small threshold the cluster may not be able to reach the 
 * balanced state when applications write and delete files concurrently.
 * 
 * <p>The tool moves blocks from highly utilized datanodes to poorly 
 * utilized datanodes iteratively. In each iteration a datanode moves or 
 * receives no more than the lesser of 10G bytes or the threshold fraction 
 * of its capacity. Each iteration runs no more than 20 minutes.
 * At the end of each iteration, the balancer obtains updated datanodes
 * information from the namenode.
 * 
 * <p>A system property that limits the balancer's use of bandwidth is 
 * defined in the default configuration file:
 * <pre>
 * <property>
 *   <name>dfs.balance.bandwidthPerSec</name>
 *   <value>1048576</value>
 * <description>  Specifies the maximum bandwidth that each datanode 
 * can utilize for the balancing purpose in term of the number of bytes 
 * per second. </description>
 * </property>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>This property determines the maximum speed at which a block will be 
 * moved from one datanode to another. The default value is 1MB/s. The higher 
 * the bandwidth, the faster a cluster can reach the balanced state, 
 * but with greater competition with application processes. If an 
 * administrator changes the value of this property in the configuration 
 * file, the change is observed when HDFS is next restarted.
 * 
 * <p>MONITERING BALANCER PROGRESS
 * <p>After the balancer is started, an output file name where the balancer 
 * progress will be recorded is printed on the screen.  The administrator 
 * can monitor the running of the balancer by reading the output file. 
 * The output shows the balancer's status iteration by iteration. In each 
 * iteration it prints the starting time, the iteration number, the total 
 * number of bytes that have been moved in the previous iterations, 
 * the total number of bytes that are left to move in order for the cluster 
 * to be balanced, and the number of bytes that are being moved in this 
 * iteration. Normally "Bytes Already Moved" is increasing while "Bytes Left 
 * To Move" is decreasing.
 * 
 * <p>Running multiple instances of the balancer in an HDFS cluster is 
 * prohibited by the tool.
 * 
 * <p>The balancer automatically exits when any of the following five 
 * conditions is satisfied:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The cluster is balanced;
 * <li>No block can be moved;
 * <li>No block has been moved for five consecutive iterations;
 * <li>An IOException occurs while communicating with the namenode;
 * <li>Another balancer is running.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Upon exit, a balancer returns an exit code and prints one of the 
 * following messages to the output file in corresponding to the above exit 
 * reasons:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The cluster is balanced. Exiting
 * <li>No block can be moved. Exiting...
 * <li>No block has been moved for 3 iterations. Exiting...
 * <li>Received an IO exception: failure reason. Exiting...
 * <li>Another balancer is running. Exiting...
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>The administrator can interrupt the execution of the balancer at any 
 * time by running the command "stop-balancer.sh" on the machine where the 
 * balancer is running.
